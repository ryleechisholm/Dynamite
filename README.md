# Dynamic CSS Library: WIP
## A css library that changes based on what premade style/color the user chooses!  No longer will every site have to look like the basic bootstrap styles
## IMPORTANT: this is the documentation/show-off repo.  The actual downloaded content will just be css/js like any other css library.
